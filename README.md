The project in which I studied the "strategy" design pattern. I also got acquainted with the Guava library and Apache Common Collections. I rewrote the standard HashMap implementation myself. Tested strategies with JUnit.
# What is Shortener
Shortener is a class that will later be used to develop a short link service based on it.
